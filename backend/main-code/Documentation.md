### Introduction

This document provides detailed documentation for the Python code found in `test.txt`, which primarily deals with interfacing with MongoDB for managing inquiries, offers, and user interactions through a Flask web application and scheduled tasks for data management.

### Modules and Libraries

- **Flask**: A micro web framework written in Python for building web applications.
- **PyMongo**: Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB.
- **Pandas**: An open-source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools for Python.
- **matplotlib**: A Python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
- **APScheduler**: A Python library that lets you schedule your Python code to be executed later, either just once or periodically.
- **os**: This module provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality.

### Functions and Classes

#### MongoDB Connection Setup

- **Purpose**: Establishes connection to MongoDB client and defines database collections.

#### Inquiry and Offer Data Handling

- `generate_inquiry_table()`
  - **Purpose**: Gathers latest inquiries from MongoDB and generates a visualization table.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: Saves a PNG image of the generated table in a specified directory.

- `generate_offer_table()`
  - **Purpose**: Collects latest offers from MongoDB and creates a table visualization.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: Outputs a table image as PNG file.

#### Flask API Endpoints

- **`/offers/table.png` and `/inquiries/table.png` Routes**
  - **Purpose**: Serves the generated tables as images for GET requests.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: PNG image file.

- **`/offer/coa/<order_id>.pdf` Route**
  - **Purpose**: Fetches a Certificate of Analysis (COA) PDF for a given order ID.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `order_id`: ID of the order.
  - **Returns**: PDF file.

- **Health Check Endpoint (`/api/v1/health`)**
  - **Purpose**: Provides a simple way to check if the server is running.
  - **Parameters**: None.
  - **Returns**: JSON response with a message indicating the server is operational.

### Scheduled Tasks

- Explains the use of `BackgroundScheduler` for creating scheduled jobs that generate inquiry and offer tables at specified times.

### Additional Notes

- Describes dependencies, external libraries, and considerations for running the code effectively.
